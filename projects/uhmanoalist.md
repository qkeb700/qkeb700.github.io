<h2>About UH Manoalist</h2>
UH Manoalist is a website that allows uh students to buy or sell their school-related items. On the web app, users can create caterogires that they want to sell or buy, and if you choose itmes you like on the app, you can buy people's items by meeting the seller in person. After your buying or selling, you can delete your transactions.

<h2>Contributions</h2>
My contributions to the web application, UH Manoalist are the landing page that shows up when you click on our web app, and it has a picture of UH manoa and contents for categories and sell an item. Other contributions to the app are the categories page, where users can put school-related items up for sale and other users can search for items they like and buy people's items; the delete page, where users can delete their transactions after finished trading.  

Through this team project, I learned a great experience working on the same project as a team. I believe I played a active role for this project and help my teammates struggling.
