### What makes software engineering interesting

Software Engineering is a lot of fun. What I find interesting in Software Engineering is that being software engineer makes me 
think creatively and develop myself at the same time. I used to get frustrated 
when I get stuck in coding programs that I wanted to create. 
However, I have tried to figure out what I have done wrong and ended up fixing the problem.
By doing the work, I can get myself improved and get more interested in Software Engineering. 

Software Engineering provides us with widen opportunities. 
It offers to get a job that can make money, and good software engineers are always in demand. 
If you are not interested in learning something , this would sound awful, but if you like to learn, in software engineering, 
there is no ending supply of fun things to learn.

Too much work form Software Engineering might cause bad effects on you, 
but if you keep up with the way how you work on it, and go through those hardships,
