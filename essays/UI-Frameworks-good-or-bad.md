## What Is UI Frameworks

  You must at least once have heard about UI Frameworks, if you are a web software engineer or interested in developing the software on Web.
What do you think the definition of UI Frameworks? What does UI Frameworks do for software engineers on Web? 
In general, UI means as you know User Interface, and UI Framework is a software tool that help programmers to develop 
their software programs to run on web. 
How is the definition of UI Framework different from what you have known about it? 
Even if your answer is not the same as the definition of UI Frameworks, it would be pretty much meaning the same thing. 
Isn’t it interesting using software tool which is one of software as well to develop other software?

## Disadvantages

  Despite this interesting thing, there are those who see UI Frameworks in a negative light. 
One of disadvantages of using UI Frameworks that they insist is unnecessary code lines. 
It would be inevitable having extra code in your web development by using UI Frameworks
because what you are going to do in UI Frameworks is to borrow a certain code that you want it to be in your web, 
but the code that you bring from UI Frameworks may have not only the options you want, but also useless code for your web.

  The second reason is that you might take longer time that you expected. It can be related to the first reason. 
If you have difficulties or are not familiar with using UI Frameworks,
it may take you longer time designing your web code than doing it with your own style code. 
It’s because if you don’t know where to find code you need for your web in UI Frameworks and how to modify them to your web,
you would spend much time figuring it out.

  The last disadvantage of using UI Frameworks is a limitation of code expression. 
If we only rely on UI Frameworks and stop thinking how to develop our code on web, 
we will get to limit ourselves from thinking creatively. 


## Advantages

  Now, we should look at the bright side of UI Frameworks. Even though there are some disadvantages of UI Frameworks like the above,
why still many people want and use UI Frameworks for their web? 
The first good reason we can come up with is that we can actually develop web in a very simple and faster way. 
All the code you need to use for your web is in UI Frameworks.
So, what you only have to do is to search for the code you want and copy and paste to your code. 
This process will save a lot of your time coding than doing in with your own code. 

  The second reason is that most people use the same semantic formats of code. 
In other words, people have the same style of designing their web. For instance, 
let’s suppose you are working with your coworkers for team project. Just like other team projects,
your team will split the project into parts, and start working on the parts separately, 
and then merge the results of the part of the project into the result of the final project. 
In this case, the team wouldn’t have a trouble with communication in their individual code
because they used the same format on UI Frameworks, so it will be easy understanding what they have coded for their parts so far.

  The last part of advantage of UI Frameworks is to make web programmers life way easier.
If there is no such a tool UI Frameworks, web programmers would have to remember and memorize a bunch of code for developing their web. 
However, by using UI Frameworks, we skip all the unnecessary prats and easily design web.


## Be part of UI Frameworks 

For those who don’t want to limit their code expression, where you use UI Frameworks is totally up to you, 
but for easier life to code and more efficient work with your coworkers, be familiar with UI Frameworks.
